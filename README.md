## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python, PyTorch and PIL.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*, PyTorch, PIL.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is from Udacity's image classification project. It trains CNN model to classify picturesof flowers.

## Files Description<a name="files"></a>

**Image Classifier Project.ipynb** It is used to build the model using the jupyter notebook. It can be used independently to see how the model works.

**cat_to_name.json** It is used in ipynb and py file to map flower number to flower names.

**train_args.py** It is used by predict.py to enable the parameter function.

**train.py** It will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint. 

**predict_args.py** It is used by predict.py to enable the parameter function.

**predict.py** It uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.
